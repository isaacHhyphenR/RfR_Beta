 ROHAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Ever since King $ROH_theoden$'s debilitating illness, Rohan has been caught between the visions of two vastly different individuals. The king's trusted advisor $ROH_grima$, named Wormtongue by his enemies, is subtle and cunning in his attempts to consolidate power and further $ISN_saruman$'s interests. The king's nephew, $ROH_eomer$, is loud and brash in his desire to remove Wormtongue, and he may stop at nothing to do so. Beyond the feilds of Calenardhon, armies muster and clouds darken-- the Rohirrim must sort out their differences quickly if they are to ride to victory in the gathering war."
 GONDOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Since the death of King Eärnur in 2050 of the Third Age, Gondor has been ruled by stewards until such time as the king should return. In these dark years, as Mount Doom rumbles and clouds gather in Mordor, it seems unlikely that Gondor shall live long enough to see such a day. All hope is not lost, however. The Tower of Guard stands strong with many stout and noble men to defend it. So long as the blood of $numenor$ remain valiant, the shadow will be kept at bay!"
 MORDOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Dark Lord Sauron was defeated at the end of the Second Age during the Last Alliance of Men and Elves when King Isildur of Gondor cut the ruling ring, into which Sauron had poured much of his power, from his finger. He has spent the last three thousand years regaining his strength, first in the distant east, then in Dol Guldur as the necromancer, and finally declaring himself openly in Mordor with the reconstruction of Barad-dûr. He now seeks to return to his ancient goal: the destruction of the Elves, the subjugation of $numenor$, and the blanketing of the world in eternal darkness."
 ISENGARD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Saruman the White is the leader of the Istari, five Maiar sent to Middle Earth in the guise of old men in order to lead the free peoples in their fight against the darkness. He, along with several powerful elves, formed the white council. For many hundreds of years he was a wise and just leader, but slowly his jealousy of Gandalf the Grey overtook him. He has begun searching for the One Ring to take its power for himself and raising an army of orcs and wildlings to assist him. His first conquest will almost certainly be the neighbouring Kingdom of Rohan, currently in the thrall of his servant Grima Wormtongue."
 DUNFELLS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Wulfgar Brynjarsson, Dunfells' fiery chieftan, has long called for the unification of Dunland and the subjugation of its neighbors. Now, as the wind of war blows through the world, he musters his tribe for a final great push. His ultimate goal is the humbling of Rohan and the reclamation of the Adorn Vale.  As of late the white wizard Saruman, keeper of Isengard, has shown greater interest in Dunland, and has sent feelers of friendship to Duneard. Wulfgar faces perhaps the greatest choice of his life: shall he join with Saruman or reject him and forge a Dunland free of wizard's meddling hand?"
 ANGRAST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Clan Morcad claims descent from the ruling dynasty of Saralainn, the ancient tribal kingdom that controlled the Southern Greyflood. Madogh III, in particular, has gained a reputation of obsessively plotting and scheming to reclaim the land he considered rightfully his. He has assasinated his half brother, exiled numerous relations, and even beat his own son within an inch of his life, all for percieved threats to his power. Folk both abroad and at home call him 'The Mad Dog of Angrast'. As he descends further into single minded paranoia and planning, black-clad riders become an ever more common sight in Angrast."
 DRULAD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "$DRU$ is neither the richest, nor most populous, nor most pretigious of lands. Despite, or perhaps because of, this obscurity, Glenis Hedricing is one of the most impressive $Greater_Enedwaith_ADJ$ chiefs. Few who stand in her presense come away untouched by her determination, her power, and most of all her passion for good. She dreams of a united $Greater_Enedwaith_ADJ$ federation where all people, regardless of tribe or status, live in peace and prosperity, free from the deadly bickering of chiefs and warlords. Few mistake her passion for naive idealism: she has made clear that she will do anything for her dream."
 ANDRAST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The fisher folk of Andrast care little for the outside world, and the outside world cares little for them. They stick to their ancient ways of sailing and shipbuilding, content to live good and simple lives."
 DRUWAITH_IAUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The narrow land betwen the river Isen and the White Mountains is rich in agriculture, wildlife, and trade. The people here, though related to the savage hill folk of Dunland, are mostly content with the bounty their home provides. That is not to say they are weak or complacent, however-- sitting, as they do, in the middle of $Greater_Enedwaith$, their warriors have fought against many people from many lands, and learned much of their ways."
 DUNLAND_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Ancestors of the Dunlendings once inhabited the plains of Calenardhon till they were driven to the hills by the Rohirrim, a grudge they have never forgotten. Countless warriors and raiders have crossed the Isen over the centuries, and large Dunlending communities still inhabit the western parts of the Mark. As foreign troubles and wars grow and spread, as Rohan is consumed by internal strife, as the light of their Gondorian allies fades, many hill folk ask themselves: is now the moment when we reclaim what is ours?"
 ENEDWAITH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Enedwaith is defined by the rivers Isen and Greyflood, avenues that bring it into contact with folk from many distand lands. Elves from Rivendell, Arnorians and Rohirrim, representatives of foreign tribes-- even, along the Belegaer coast, Corsairs and Southrons. While many are content to profit from these foreigners simply through trade, many others seek to profit through knowledge and alliance. Even in this corner of the world, so far from Barad-dûr and Minas Tirith, there are those with ambition to restore ancient glory and forge new power."
 EREGION_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Eregion was once a great kingdom of elves, but that glory collapsed long ago when Sauron's army laid waste to its capital of Ost-in-Edhil. In the millenia since, many human tribes have built their own kingdoms and cultures upon the ruins. Some have befriended the elven remnants in Rivendell, seeking to learn their wisdom, while others see that they hold a prime position: any dark lord whishing to finally eliminate Elrond's homely house must march through their land. Perhaps, by allying with this inevitable army, they can claim a piece of the spoils."
 WHITE_MOUNTAINS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The folk of the White Mountains have always had a troubled relationship with their southern neighbour. Tribes once inhabited the entire range, but have long since been pushed out by Gondorian rule. Some still inhabit the heights above Morthond in grudging suzerainty to the White City, but most live in the far western portion of the chain. Now the hour of revenge ripens on the vine: Gondor is weak, its enemies strong. Whether allied with the dark lord or not, all warriors of the White Mountains sense that his return is an opportunity they cannot afford to waste."
 DORWINION_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "While the Dorwinrims' great loves of wine and trade lead them to shun conflict with foreign realms, their third great love spawns many conflicts at home: politics. With an election looming as Realm Master Hawin Koldana ages, the Winelords and Great Merchants bring out their bribes and speeches once more. While traditional clashes of urban vs rural, merit vs blood, and progress vs tradion underpin their rivalry, something far greater overshadows this election: the growing darkness in the East. Should Dorwinion join it? Trust in the strength of Men? Or perhaps they should bring a new light into the world..."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Middle Earth is filled with evils that threaten death and destruction upon their neighbours. Since the fall of Sauron at the end of the Second Age these threats have been disparate and regional, acting with uncoordinated malice. When the Dark Lord openly declared himself again in 2951, evil creatues began multiplying and attacking with new ferocity. From the hills of Dunland to the shadows of Mirkwood, from the caves of the Misty Mountains to the havens of Umbar, from the ruins of Carn Dûm to the cursed city of Minas Morgul, armies gather under the banner of the lidless eye."

 rfr_news.11.d: "$GON_denethor$, steward of Gondor, has long used the $palantir$ of Minas Tirith to spy upon the workings of Mordor, and Sauron has long twisted these visions to make the coming war seem hopeless. Today, finally giving into despair, Denethor decided that he would rather command his own death than succumb to the inevitable tide of darkness.

Cirion and King Eorl swore an oath of eternal friendship, and many times the two realms have assisted each other against the forces of evil. Gondor has once again called upon that oath, lighting the warning beacons and sending a red arrow north to ask for aid-- and aid they shall recieve!

 rfr_country_info.1.t: "Welcome to Gondor"
 rfr_country_info.1.d: "Gondor is the most powerful of the free peoples-- and the closest to Mordor, which will likely declare war on you in 3019. Rohan is your main ally, but should they fall to Isengard you will see a host of foes marching through Anorien. You are a kingdom ruled by a steward, which significantly weakens you; your enemies will be vastly stronger than you until either you crown a king or the One Ring is destroyed. Once you have crowned a king, your focus tree allows you to gain cores on and annex all the old $numenorean$ lands."
 rfr_country_info.1.a: "The blood of $numenor$ runs strong in our veins"
 rfr_country_info.2.t: "Welcome to Isengard"
 rfr_country_info.2.d: "The Ring of Isengard encloses a forested courtyard and the stone tower of Orthanc. Your focus tree allows for rapid industrialisation & population growth, but you will have to instill discipline into your subjects before you can utilise them effectively. Before you begin your conquest you must choose whether to join with Sauron or dominate Middle Earth for yourself. The tribes of Dunland will submit readily enough to your overlordship, but Rohan will fight firecely. If your war goes poorly you can always escape to the Shire."
 rfr_country_info.2.a: "The Wise must rule the lesser peoples"
 rfr_country_info.3.t: "Welcome to Mordor"
 rfr_country_info.3.d: "The Dark Lord Sauron seeks to subjugate all of Middle Earth. The central branch of your focus tree provides you significant economic and military bonuses. The Northern, Eastern, and Southern branches will puppet or grant wargoals on every country east of the Misty Mountains. The Western branch focuses on your most important-- and difficult-- enemy: Gondor. Pay careful attention to which ring victory points you control, because the consequences of failure are severe."
 rfr_country_info.3.a: "They shall all bow before Barad-dûr"
 rfr_country_info.4.t: "Welcome to Rohan"
 rfr_country_info.4.d: "Rohirric politics are dominated by the struggle between the king's evil advisor Gríma Wormtongue and the king's nephew Éomer. Siding with Éomer leads to a civil war, allowing for war with Isengard before they are prepared. Siding with Gríma allows you to either keep the peace until Gandalf expels Gríma in March 3018 OR attempt to place Gríma on the throne and align with Isengard. You have limited options in the first several years, but can rapidly gain several powerful buffs once you get rid of Gríma. Isengard is your main enemy, but Mordor will attack you once they've finished with Gondor-- if you haven't already headed their call to arms."

 rfr_country_info.5.d: "The long cape is a sleepy corner of Middle Earth. Protected by high mountains, perilous swamp, this forest, and treacherous storms, the outside world is unlikely to trouble you unless you trouble it. The $Andrast_ADJ$ tribes are less populous, developed, and warlike than their neighbours to the North and East, so any aggression must be undertaken with caution."

 rfr_country_info.6.d: "Situated directly in the middle of $greater_enedwaith$ presents you with many opporutnities for expansion, and many enemies who whish to expand into you. Your focus tree contains several buffs to diplomatically interacting with the Blood Oath system. Neither Isengard nor Rohan are likely to initiate interaction with you, but you can easily align yourself with either."
 rfr_country_info.6.a: "We are the key to $greater_enedwaith$"
 rfr_country_info.7.t: "Welcome to $Dunland$"
 rfr_country_info.7.d: "The tribes of $Dunland$ are some of the most populous and developed in $greater_enedwaith$. You can gain several cores on Rohan, but taking them without Isengard's help may prove challenging. Be careful how closely you align yourself with Saruman, as he will demand you swear a Blood Oath to him-- the friendlier you are with him, the higher the penalties for refusing."
 rfr_country_info.7.a: "We will have our revenge upon the Horselords"
 rfr_country_info.8.t: "Welcome to $Enedwaith$"
 rfr_country_info.8.d: "Be careful of your eastern flank, as both Saruman and his Dunlending lackeys eye your lands greedily. Cardolan pose no threat to you, but crossing the Greyflood to reclaim Minhiriath may prove challenging."
 rfr_country_info.8.a: "Saralain will rise once more"
 rfr_country_info.9.t: "Welcome to $Eregion$"
 rfr_country_info.9.d: "The rivers, swamps, forests, and mountains that line Eregion are its strongest defence, as the lands are more sparsely populated here than to the South. The ruined city of Tharbad could prove highly valuable if restored, which would require either befriending or conquering the Northern half. Friendship with the elves of Imladris may also reap dividends."
 rfr_country_info.9.a: "We shall not fall as the elves once did"
 rfr_country_info.10.t: "Welcome to $White_Mountains$"
 rfr_country_info.10.d: "Gondor contains many lands better ruled by you; of particular interest are the White Mountains of Morthond, where revolution simmers. However, you cannot hope to defeat them alone; making friends with Gondor's enemies may be wise. Tribes from the North and West may try to cross the mountain passes, so maintain vigilance."

 rfr_election.1.t: "The Dorwin Republic!"
 rfr_election.1.d: "Jubilation has overtaken the streets of every city at the news: free and open elections will be held to choose Dorwinion's first president! A group of senators, emboldened by guild funding and popular support, confronted [ROOT.GetLeader] with an ultimatum: put down [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerHis] crown or face revolution. [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] chose to peacefully abolish the office of Realm Master and hand over power to the people. The struggle for democracy has been long and hard, and now the Dorwin people may finally choose their leader."
 rfr_election.1.a: "$DOR_thodria_celebcaen$ will unify the North!"

Any citizen can nominate themselves, but only those with existing connections and influence have any realistic chance of gathering enough votes to win. The four main candidates all boast impressive resumes of Guild leadership and played important roles in bringing about the Republic. Though any of them would surely make an excellent $republic_leader$, each has vastly divergent priorities and goals. The time has come for the people to decide: who shall lead Dorwinion?"

 rfr_election.3.d: "The time has come, once again, for the $DOR_ADJ$ people to make their voices heard, though many doubt the importance of their vote. Money and connections have always played an outsized role in the Dorwin Republic, but [ROOT.GetLeader]'s consolidation of power has only excacerbated these issues. All hope is not lost for the republic; [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHisCap] opponents believe that, if they can only match [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHim] in resources, they can overcome [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHis] bribes and intimidation to preserve democracy in Dorwinion."

 senate.1.t: "Senate Debates Election in [senate_state.GetName]"
 senate.1.d: "The two main political factions have each proposed candidates for council positions in [senate_state.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The first is the Guilds' candidate who promises incentives for the various trades that encompass our market. On the other hand, the Merchant Houses' candidate has argued for more trade with neighboring countries and better relations with everyone in the region.

 senate.2.d: "A new issue has popped up in front of the Senate, the issue of overflowing patriotism of our youth in the [senate_state.GetName] county. An imminent senator has provided a solution for this in which we encourage our people to help the war effort. There are many ways a person can join the war effort such as by joining the army or by helping in the production of equipment. The choice lies with us."
 senate.2.a: "Call up more eager recruits!"

 senate.4.t: "Senate Debates Raising Tariffs"
 senate.4.d: "A prominent merchant has raised the issue of raised tariffs with the senate. Particularly the [senate_state.GetName] state has been affected by this. He proposed that we use the new funds to hire more instructors for the Trade School, thereby encouraging more students to join it and become merchants. Another budget put forward by the Mayor includes the expansion of the points of entry allowing for increased trade and development. The Local Guard Captain has also proposed funding the reinforcement of the militia. Or we can leave the rates as they are. What should we choose?"

 senate.8.t: "Senate Debates Import Deals"
 senate.8.d: "The Merchant Houses have approached us, inquiring whether they should prioritize an import deal with our neighbors. From [ERE.GetNameDef], we can obtain the most magnificent toys and metal products ever seen, while from [DAL.GetNameDef], we can acquire food and other human-made products. There has even been talk of a caravan venturing across the desert to [RUN.GetNameDef] to obtain the finest horses and oxen.

 senate.9.d: "In the Senate, a lively debate ensues over the issue of cultural funding. The options include commissioning a play on democracy's struggle, funding a song celebrating the land's beauty, erecting a statue for fallen heroes, or taking a financially prudent stance against such expenditures.

 senate.10.t: "Senate Debates Excess Workers"
 senate.10.d: "Within the grandeur of Dorwinion's Senate chambers, a palpable tension lingers as senators deliberate over the surplus workforce predicament. Each proposed solution carries weighty implications, offering a glimpse into potential futures for the republic. The decision to redirect labor to the fields might impact agricultural productivity while channeling efforts into [senate_state.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] could shape the city's economic landscape. Equipping workers with arms could alter the balance of power, and choosing non-interference may influence the city's social dynamics, leaving the Senate to navigate a path forward with lasting consequences."

 senate.10.b: "Put them to work in [senate_state.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
